# 🌟 Austin Animal Shelter Adoption Dashboard 🐶🐱
I’m excited to share my latest Data Analysis project where I explored adoption trends at the Austin Animal Shelter using Excel, SQL, and Power BI.
## 📊 Project Overview:
 The goal was to understand the key factors influencing animal adoptions and outcomes over time.
### 🔧 Tools Used:
Excel – for initial data cleaning and validation
SQL – to query and organize large datasets efficiently
Power BI – for building an interactive and insightful dashboard
### 💡 Key Insights:
Adoption Rate: 42% of total animals were adopted
Total Animals: 78.2K animals recorded
Top Animal Type: Dogs made up 56% of shelter residents
Euthanized Animals: 6.1K – showing areas for further improvement
Adoption by Color: Black animals had the highest adoption count (18.9K)
Age Group: Adults were adopted slightly more than puppies
### 📈 What I Learned:
 This project helped me strengthen my data cleaning workflow in Excel, optimize SQL queries for analysis, and design clear, story-driven visuals in Power BI.
### 🐾 I believe data can make a real difference — even in helping more animals find their forever homes.

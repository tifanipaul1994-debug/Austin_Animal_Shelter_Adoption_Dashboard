# 🐾 Austin Animal Shelter Outcomes Analysis
## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores data from an animal shelter to analyze patterns and trends in animal outcomes such as adoption, transfer, and euthanasia. The goal is to understand the factors influencing outcomes based on attributes like breed, color, age, sex, and spay/neuter status.

By performing data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, this project helps uncover insights that can improve animal welfare decisions and shelter operations.

## 🎯 Objectives

Identify the most common animal types and breeds in the shelter.

Analyze adoption trends by age, color, and spay/neuter status.

Examine seasonal or monthly trends in animal outcomes.

Compare outcomes by sex and breed mix (mixed or purebred).

Provide actionable insights to improve adoption rates and reduce euthanasia.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Data visualization dashboard

SQL – Data querying and filtering

Excel / Python (optional) – Data cleaning and preparation

### 📈 Key Insights (example ideas)

Most adopted animals are young dogs and cats under 2 years old.

Spayed/Neutered animals have a higher chance of adoption.

The majority of animals are mixed breeds, especially among dogs.

Summer months show the highest adoption rates.
